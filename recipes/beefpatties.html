        <li>Pour plain flour into a large mixing bowl and add a tablespoon each of curry powder, turmeric, baking powder and salt. Mix until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Add cubes of butter into the mixing bowl and rub-in until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Pour half of the milk into the mixture and mix together before pouring the remaining half bit-by-bit mixing each time.</li>
        <li>Use your hands to bring the dough together. Then place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, you can use this time to prepare the filling.</li>
        <li>Pour the minced (grounded) beef into a large mixing bowl and add a tablespoon of smoked paprika, onion powder, all purpose seasoning, garlic powder and black pepper. Mix together until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Add oil to a pan and heat on a high heat. Fry the garlic, onions, spring onions, ginger, thyme and scotch bonnet for 2 to 3 mins.</li>
        <li>Add the minced beef meat into the frying pan and stir continuously, add a tablespoon of smoked paprika, onion powder, all purpose seasoning, garlic powder and black pepper. Continue to fry for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, ketchup and a tablespoon of browning sauce and mix until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Leave to simmer for 5 minutes with the lid on, then continue to stir for 2 to 3 minutes breaking any clumps with the back of your wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Flour your work surface and roll out the pastry, cut out circle shapes using a bowl (or plate). Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the beef filling to the lower centre of the pastry.</li>
        <li>Make an egg wash by whisking an egg and use it to coat the edge of one half of the pastry. Fold over the pastry and press the edges together with your fingers. With a fork, dip it in flour and press down to create the authentic patty crimped edges.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (gas mark 4, 350°F). Coat the pastry with an egg wash and bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
