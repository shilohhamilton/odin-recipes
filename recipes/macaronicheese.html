    <p>This perfect baked macaroni cheese recipe comes with a creamy cheese sauce, a hint of mustard and uses leftover French stick for its crunchy topping</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>50g baguette, cut into small chunks</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter, plus 1 tbsp melted</li>
        <li>350g spiral or other short pasta</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp English mustard powder</li>
        <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>500ml whole milk</li>
        <li>250g vegetarian mature cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Spread the baguette chunks over a baking sheet, drizzle with the melted butter and season. Bake for 6 mins until crisp, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Boil the pasta for 2 mins less than stated on the pack, then drain. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the garlic and English mustard powder, cook for 1 min, then stir in the plain flour.</li>
        <li>Cook for 1 min more, then gradually whisk in the milk until you have a lump-free sauce. Simmer for 5 mins, whisking all the time until thickened. Take off the heat, then stir in the cheddar and half the parmesan.</li>
        <li>Stir the pasta and some seasoning into the cheesy sauce. Tip into a large ovenproof dish, or four individual dishes.</li>
        <li>Scatter over the bread and the remaining parmesan, then bake for 20 mins until crisp and golden. Can be frozen before baking â€“ defrost thoroughly before cooking.</li>
